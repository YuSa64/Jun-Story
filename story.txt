Hello, my name is Hyeon Jun Jeong. You can call me Jun.
I'm not sure what to say though, I'm usually do not talk much because I don't feel it is necessary. (Well, I'm not social person too).
I'm from the South Korea. It's been almost three years studying in the US. I'm junior standing now, and looking for a starting internships because I've done nothing yet.
